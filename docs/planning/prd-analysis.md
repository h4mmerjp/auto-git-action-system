# PRD Analysis - Auto Generated

## Project Overview

Based on the provided PRD, this project involves creating a hierarchical task management application with automatic schedule adjustment capabilities.

## Key Requirements Identified

### Core Features
- **Hierarchical Task Management**: Unlimited nesting of parent-child task relationships
- **Automatic Schedule Adjustment**: Core feature that automatically adjusts child task schedules when parent tasks change
- **Project Management**: Full project lifecycle management with metadata
- **Collaboration Features**: Team member management and real-time updates

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Material-UI/Ant Design
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express or Python + FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with hierarchical data support
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live updates
- **Authentication**: JWT + OAuth 2.0

## Complexity Assessment

- **High Complexity**: Automatic schedule dependency management
- **Medium Complexity**: Hierarchical data visualization, real-time updates
- **Standard Complexity**: CRUD operations, authentication, basic UI

## Technical Challenges

1. **Hierarchical Data Management**: Self-referencing foreign keys and recursive queries
2. **Schedule Dependency Logic**: Complex algorithms for automatic adjustment
3. **Real-time Synchronization**: Ensuring data consistency across multiple users
4. **Performance**: Efficient handling of large task hierarchies (1000+ tasks)

## Recommended Development Approach

1. Start with basic project and task CRUD operations
2. Implement hierarchical task structure
3. Add basic scheduling functionality
4. Implement automatic adjustment algorithms
5. Add real-time features and collaboration
6. Optimize performance and add advanced visualizations
